# The Monty08 Microprocessor
An 8 Bit Accumulator Processor featuring a Microcode-ALU. First built in LogiSim -> then on Breadboard! The file ```Monty08.xlsx``` features the ISA and all microcode programming.

## How to use
This project uses the latest (but old) version of default Logisim to simulate all functinalities. To open the project yourself: open the ```CPU.circ``` file inside Logisim.

## What's next?
The microprocessor is in early developementand changes periodically so images and more documentation will follow soon...
